# What I learned
The idea coming into this was to have fundamental understanding of how vue works to use it for my development with the teams at UCT.

So did it do my mission justice? Yes, although I relied on my knowledge of React through some explanations, but there were a few fundamental add-ons:
1. Vue router
2. Backend

Both seem to improve upon what I used in my anrilombard.com website and could speed up the development for the next website.
The backend allows me to retain information changed, so I could add a comment section so visitors can voluntarely give feedback on what they believe could
improve.

This is the tip of the proverbial iceberg, but with these few ideas alone I, and any developer, could build small-scale apps. Ultimately, it is a good
strengthener for the base branches of the semantic tree model used for learning.
